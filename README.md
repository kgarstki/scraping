This repo holds a few different tools for extracting data. Some are taken from the [o-date/scraping](https://github.com/o-date/scraping) GitHub repo. Make sure to fork this repo and set up your own binder to work with the notebooks. 

Check out the [Week-6_1](https://github.com/kgarstki/ANTH-641_Week-6_Exercise-1/blob/master/Week%206_1.md) file in this repo for the instructions.
